# university-companion-app

### A companion application which uses the Fontys Hogescholen API to display information like:
* List of the classes of the person logged in - schedule
* List of teachers in the stream
* Building list
 
### Android development specifics I learned while making this project:
* Activities and Fragments
* Intents
* Adapter views
* Navigation, using the navigation component
* Remote access and async tasks
* System services
  
### Note: I have excluded the Token retrieval code for privacy reasons
